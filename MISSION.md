# Empowering Next-Generation Technologies with JavaScript Libraries for Edge Computing

## Mission
Our mission is to empower developers and communities to leverage the power of edge computing in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), P2P computing, Blockchain, and Internet of Things (IoT) through state-of-the-art JavaScript libraries. We believe that centralized systems and power structures in the digital realm pose significant risks to individual autonomy, diversity, and innovation. We advocate for a paradigm shift towards decentralized, distributed, and community-driven technologies. We are committed to providing open-source, user-friendly, and scalable solutions that democratize access to advanced computing capabilities and enable developers to build innovative applications at the edge. 

We strive to push the boundaries of what's possible with JavaScript by developing libraries that optimize computation, storage, and communication at the edge, enabling low-latency processing, efficient resource utilization, and enhanced privacy and security. We aim to foster a collaborative and inclusive community that encourages knowledge-sharing, experimentation, and co-creation among developers, researchers, and stakeholders in the field of edge computing.

## Guiding Principles
Our project is guided by the following principles:

Innovation and Advancement: We believe in pushing the frontiers of technology and continuously innovating to create cutting-edge JavaScript libraries that unlock the potential of edge computing in AI, ML, AR, VR, and IoT. We strive to stay up-to-date with the latest advancements in the field and actively contribute to the evolution of edge computing technologies.

Accessibility and Usability: We aim to make edge computing accessible to a wide range of developers by developing user-friendly and well-documented JavaScript libraries that are easy to integrate into existing applications. We focus on providing clear documentation, tutorials, and examples to foster ease of use and adoption, regardless of the level of expertise.

Scalability and Performance: We prioritize the development of JavaScript libraries that are scalable and performant, allowing for efficient and effective processing of data at the edge. We optimize for low-latency, high-throughput, and minimal resource utilization, enabling developers to build high-performance edge computing applications for a variety of use cases.

Openness and Collaboration: We embrace the principles of open source and believe in fostering a collaborative community that encourages participation, contribution, and co-creation. We strive to create a welcoming and inclusive environment that values diverse perspectives and encourages collaboration among developers, researchers, and stakeholders in the field of edge computing.

Interoperability and Flexibility: We believe in the interoperability of edge computing technologies and strive to develop JavaScript libraries that are flexible and compatible with other relevant technologies and frameworks. We aim to provide libraries that can be easily integrated into different edge computing environments, including diverse hardware and software platforms.

Community Engagement and Empowerment: We aim to empower the developer community by actively engaging with developers, researchers, and stakeholders in the field of edge computing. We provide opportunities for community feedback, contributions, and collaborations, and strive to create a supportive and inclusive community that fosters learning, sharing, and growth.

With our mission and guiding principles, we aspire to be at the forefront of edge computing in the context of AI, ML, AR, VR, Blockchain, P2P and IoT, and to empower developers and communities to build innovative and impactful applications at the edge using JavaScript libraries.
